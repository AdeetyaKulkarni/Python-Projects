I absolutely love Bumble! I now no longer have a need for it but I just want to say it works! After ending a very terrible marriage I often wondered if I was destined to be alone forever. I never thought I would find someone who would want to date me especially with having 4 children. However after some encouragement from friends I took a chance to meet some new people, at first was not even looking for a relationship just looking to meet some men from other areas maybe go on a date or two, nothing to serious. Within a few days time and a handful of conversations with other potentials, I initially didn’t know where using this app was heading. I met quite a few people that just weren’t for me, but then I met my soulmate! He and I hit it off instantly we both knew there was something special going on. Wishing 5 days of meeting we met for our first date and now here we are 6 months later. We are head over heels in love with each other. We now live together in a beautiful home and he just recently proposed! So now I have a fiancé &amp; we are to be married next year! We are so happy and we are both so grateful for your app! I never would have met him if not for Bumble! My fiancé and I use the app now only to send each other messages on our monthly anniversary’s! I encourage everyone to give Bumble a chance!

I like the new features that have been added. When guys show what they’re looking for it’s easy for me to easily swipe left if they say they just want something casual. However, I find it annoying when there are still guys that come up in my match queue and they don’t want a relationship. I know it’s out of the app designer’s control that guys are too lazy to actually see what girls are looking for, but I wish it was more obvious like putting a big ol’ stamp on someone’s profile lol. Just a joke...unless you can do it. In the past I tried to put a picture of myself holding a small note that says I’m not interested in hookups to make it more obvious for the guys, but according to Bumble that’s not appropriate because they “can’t see me”. I find that annoying as there are some guys I’ve seen only use memes on their profile or wear sunglasses and/or hats in all of their photos. I don’t mind the hats...but the sunglasses, at least in my opinion, can hide one’s identity. I want to see a guy’s full face. Is it possible to put a limit on how many photos are posted wearing sunglasses or maybe just ban them? Oh and it’d be great to have the option to find guy friends as well on Bumble BFF. I also noticed there’s a character limit to the messages I try to send. Is it possible to have unlimited characters or be like Twitter and show when I’ve typed too much?

I used to enjoy bumble, but then, like most software people, they have to tinker with it and think they’re making it better and they made it much worse. I even wrote a letter asking why they did what they did. Here is why you should NOT PAY. They used to have a mileage feature on the site, which made sense. Lots of us don’t want to date somebody more than a certain distance away. They removed the mileage feature and offered some ridiculous explanation of “oh we want to make sure that anyone in the world who wants to see you blah blah blah”.  (It was such a stupid explanation whatever it was). Well, I drove from DC to Connecticut and back. When I got back to DC, sure it’s swell to have women interested, but they were up and down the eastern seaboard. Before, with the mileage feature, anyone outside whatever mileage I had set, just went away. NOW, because of their awful software, I have to click on EVERY one of them to see if they are local or not? Are you kidding? “Oh look, someone  in RI (delete), oh here is NY (delete), oh another one in RI (delete), wait, one in VA! Oops MA (delete)” shoot me now!<br/><br/>So what I figured out (and they will figure out how to counter what I figured out and then I will delete the app) and the reason you don’t pay is now ALL the ones interested just stay in ONE little green circle and you don’t have to deal with it. If you pay, they ALL show up in an endless stream of green circles and never disappear. Do not pay!!!!

As the title says, I’ve been using the service for one full year now and even have done so as an upgraded member (which I will not be renewing my upgraded status). I admittedly commend the POF customer service people for swiftly removing bogus profiles (there’s a disgusting amount of them). However, that leads me to point out one big flaw the site has, approving obviously bogus profiles. When you make a profile you have to wait for it to be approved making sure it follows the sites terms, however, a substantial amount of profiles breaking just about every rule in their TOS flood the site regularly. What is the point of the profile approval process if they don’t thoroughly review the profiles before approving them? It’s a good thing this site has so many features for free users that are lacking on competing services such Match, because without those the site wouldn’t be worth the time or effort to wade through all the profiles with  “NSA/FWB”, or “contact me on KIK!” In their bios.<br/><br/>All that aside, the app itself runs smoothly and I’ve rarely have issues being able to get where I need to or clicking on things. It has crashed a couple times and occasionally runs slow, but those are more or less minor inconveniences.<br/><br/>The bottom line, do give the site and app a shot as a free user cause you’ll have nothing to lose, but don’t make the mistake I did and waste your money on being an upgraded user.

In general I have to say the app and the site are great.  I've met some really awesome guys, a few turned out to be great friends, a few I've dated exclusively. The app is super user friendly with no apparent glitches.  <br/>Unfortunately, as with most things, there are the bad apples that spoil the whole basket for us.  There are a TON let me repeat a TON of foreign scammers on this site.  They are easily recognizable.  They steal photos from others and create fake profiles. The English usage is very bad.  They typically use "am" a lot, e.g., "am living in Pittsburgh, am Joe by name,", clearly no one in Pittsburgh (or any city) speaks this way.  Pointed questions about where they say they live go unanswered.  The guys usually say they are looking to get married and their wife died of horrible cancer...yet they can't describe what type.  Careers are typically vague or military saying they are with special forces in Syria.  Take it from me, special forces US military would not be on the internet saying where they are. Duh.  Their ultimate goal seems to be to get your personal email address. Be cautious as there is nothing good that will come from giving these people your personal email address. My guess is that companies are outsourcing data mining for marketing purposes using dating sites.  Be careful!

I have messaged people on this app for a while now and received but one reply. This reply was from a bot trying to advertise. The time spent trying to create an account (putting your heart and soul into it) so you can hopefully meet someone that you would spend the rest of your life with is a waste. If you do not subscribe for paid services, you will be trolled by the app itself with random bot accounts. You will see people who are interested and want to meet but won’t find out that these people are obvious bots. Once you find matches you will go through an endless supply of “people” logging on to say they are interested and want to meet up but, they will never respond to your messages. The messages will go unread forever. This is Weird because if they were interested and wanted to meet then, they would respond. Also, I have been added to “people’s” favorite list at least 20 times over the past two days. Once you subscribe and try to find out who these matches are that found you so interesting.....you are let down because their account was deleted or removed by POF. Seems like a scam to give the perception that someone is always looking. If you want to waste your time and money....well really....your life.....download and pay for this app. I’m not sure what the legitimacy was given by the comments previous to mine but, they are wrong. Please don’t waste your time on this app.
