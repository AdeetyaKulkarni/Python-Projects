SUBJECT: Asbestos Survey
CASNR Annex Building former Animal Science
Building Renovation (#15-15700)
On September 15, 2016, Asbestos Management Section personnel conducted a survey in
support of an Engineering Services renovation project. The scope of work consists of
installation of new windows, new ceiling, ale unit removal, and HY AC upgrade at the
CASNR building. The survey consisted of a review of previous sampling reports, including
the ENSR asbestos survey, an on-site visit, and the collection of bulk samples from materials
not previously identified. Collected samples were forwarded to J3 Resources, Inc. for bulk
sample analysis using polarized light microscopy (PLM) techniques. Lab results for the
homogenous building materials are listed below. The following building materials were
verified during the on-site visit
Homogeneous Materials Positive for Asbestos
HM 01; Original Steam TSI on Steam System Piping or Associated Debris
(Abandoned/Cut former Radiator System - Pipe tunnel, chases, above plaster ceilings or
other inaccessible areas - The original steam system piping installed in 1951 fed the radiator
system in the east section of the building via a perimeter piping tunnel. During building
additions circa, 1960' s, additional piping tunnels were instaJied around the perimeter areas of
new construction. New steam system piping to HY AC units and other equipment was
installed during new construction (see Homogeneous Material No. 0 I B). TTU personal have
previously identified the original steam system insulation as ACM, with many areas of
extensive debris. There are multiple areas of associated debris and/or cut lagging insulation
remaining in piping tunnel s, above ceilings, chases and in other inaccessible meas throughout
the facility. Seven (7) samples were taken of steam system piping insulation and associated
debris throughout the building. All seven samples were determined to contain ashestos
