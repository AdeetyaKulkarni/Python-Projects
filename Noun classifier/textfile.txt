TO:	Asbestos Compliance Group
FROM:	Doug Sims
DATE:	September 11, 2014
SUBJECT:	Asbestos Weekly Meeting (Typically Wednesdays 10-11 at EH&S room 118) In Doug’s office today since we postponed from yesterday.
================================================================

Attendees: Travis Dodson, Jose Hernandez, Mike Toombs, Doug Sims, and David Noret who just happened to be there.

1.Looked at our Asbestos Compliance Status Board spreadsheet and went over Brenda
Bullard’s changes. The plan is to plot it out each week at a large enough scale that we
 can mark it up at the meetings. It will be linked to all to view at any time once it is at a
 stage that is deemed useful. We discussed that the tasks assigned on the board will be
 redundant with a separate task assignment system so that there will hopefully be no
 confusion over who is assigned to a task.
2.	Discussed the evaluation being written for our training provider by HSC and the
 possibly of future trainings with another provider. We all agreed that we prefer our
 current provider, but it may be desirable to bring a new provider in for a year every
 once in a while just to get a different perspective. We will get Hilda’s group much
 more involved in the decision making process in the future.
3.	Discussed the possible annual over calibration of some of our instrumentation. We
 may be able to save some dollars by minimizing the calibration and simply shelving
 some of the older equipment.
4.	We looked at the AIMs program and Mr. Toombs showed us how it works.
5.	We briefly discussed our interaction with FP&C and being proactive to remind them
 that we are here to serve their projects as well as Physical Plant’s projects.
6.	We discussed the format of these meetings and the rule that they will always be limited
 to 1 hour with a goal to be as brief as possible.

Thanks
